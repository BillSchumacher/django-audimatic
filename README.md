Usage

1. Add to INSTALLED_APPS

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        "django_audimatic",
        ...
    ]
    ```

2. Create audit trail tables and subclass AuditTrigger
    
    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
    from django_audimatic.models import AuditTrail, AuditTrigger


    class UserAuditTrail(AuditTrail):
        pass
    
    
    class CustomUser(AbstractUser, AuditTrigger):
        class Meta(AuditTrigger.Meta):
            audit_table = UserAuditTrail
    ```
   
3. Register AdminModels
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin
    
    from django_audimatic.admin import DiffInline
    from testapp.models import CustomUser, UserAuditTrail
    
    
    class CustomUserAuditTrail(DiffInline):
        model = CustomUser.get_audit_table()
    
    
    class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
        inlines = (CustomUserAuditTrail,)
    
    
    admin.site.register(UserAuditTrail, admin.ModelAdmin)
    admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
    
    ```

4. Add HStoreExtension
   ```python
   from django.contrib.postgres.operations import HStoreExtension
   
   ...
       operations = [
           HStoreExtension(),
       ]
   ...
   ```

Other
---

This project uses django-pgtrigger and django-nonrelated-inlines.

Currently, (as of Django 4.2.4) there is logic that registers these automatically, this might break in future version of Django.

There is functionality to disable migration support in pgtrigger, however that is not recommended or tested.

Inlines will always be registered as well, this is for simplicity, but maybe we add some options in the future.
